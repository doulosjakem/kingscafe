#Modification log:     #

        Version 0.0 - 08/26/2022 - Mod Log, initial files, and essential folders created. Nav Bar, and logo developed.

        Version 0.4 - 08/27/2022 - Logo redesigned and reintegrated, colors reworked. Thematic color scheme integrated.
        
        Version 0.7 - 08/27/2022 - Main Section started. Featured Drinks section created, and About us initialized. 

        Version 0.9 - 08/28/2022 - Added Favicons. Created footer logo, background image, Email List signup with javascript email validation, and copyright end.

        Version 1.0 - 08/28/2022 - Site ready to launch, double checked documentation, looked for grammatical errors

        Version 1.1 - 09/07-2022 - Created templates for the About, FAQs, and Contact sections.

        Version 1.2 - 09/08/2022 - Added content to the contact form, and added functionality with contact.js.

        Version 1.3 - 09/09/2022 - Redesigned the contact form to use bootstraps input groups. Added text to the FAQs, and designed the groupsize.js, in testing though I ended up merging that file with the contact.js so that they can both work. Disabled smoothscroll.js for now, experimented with hiding elements for faqs.js and FAQs section, and revealing them when they are clicked on, does not yet work and code is commented out.

        Version 1.4 - 09/21/2022 - Merged javascript files and implemented jQuery. Ensured that the FAQ's dropdown, groupsize calc, and contact forms all work. The email link at the bottom needs looked at.

        Version 1.5 - 09/23/2022 - Updated FAQs to have animated dropdowns, I should add icons that indicate the text is clickable in the future. Redesigned the Menu to a slide show with updated images after I failed trying to design a carousel. I added the Location section to the site, including a map. After tinkering around with google maps and not wanting to give credit card info to set up an API, I found a way to implement google maps without doing that.

        Version 1.6 - 10/01/2022 - Added new Partners section, included three widgets. Accordion in FAQS, Tabs in the About, and Progressbar in partners. I also updated the contact page and groupsize calculator to include a span for errors and succesful submission. Contact, and EmailList still need some work. Contact needs a currency spinner and error messaging needs some work. Email still needs a span instead of whatever causes the page to refresh.

        Version 1.65 - 10/05/2022 - Began to fill in the about section with meaninful content. Fixed the Email List scripting to no longer refresh the page on submit, but rather display that the submission has been received (even if nothing is typed).

        Version 1.7 - 10/12/2022 - Completed the about section, updated all forms to include regular expressions and new areas for error texts to go. Added date object to contact section. Added alt tags for images.

With our dedication to serving our community and belief that Christ is glorified in our craft we aim to provide you with a cup of coffee made from fresh roasted high quality beans. Most coffee goes stale a month after it's roasted even with fancy packaging, by roasting our beans in small batchs in-house we are able to provide you with fresh roasted flavors such as:

                  <p>King's Cafe is a locally owned and operated coffee shop that aims to serve the people of our community with high quality drinks. We, like all other business and people are not neutral about Christ. We seek to glorify God in all we do and that is reflected in the quality drinks we make. We strive to positively impact our community by carrying out the great commission of our Lord to disciple the nations, starting first with our community. Does that mean that if you don't believe as us you won't be comfortable here? As far as it depends on us, that won't be the case. We're OK with you believing differently than us. This is a business and we're happy to talk coffee as well as talk about Christ. You can buy our coffee and we'll do our job. We're here not for the sake of coffee, but to serve people as an extension of our faith in Christ just as the christian businesses of old did long before us. So come, enjoy a glass with us.</p>

Jesus came not to call those who think they are righteous, but those who know they are sinners <small>(Matthew 9:13)</small>. Are you a good person? Examine yourself using the 10 commandments, if God were to judge you based on these, how would you do? <small>(Exodus 20:2-17)</small>:

                      <li>You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor</li>
                      <li>You shall not covet</li>
                    </ol>
                    Jesus summarized all the Law and the Prophets with the two greatest commandments saying <small>(Matthew 22:36-40 NAS)</small>:
                    <ol>
                      <li>"‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ This is the great and foremost commandment."</li>
                      <li>"The second is like it, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ Upon these two commandments hang the whole Law and the Prophets.”"</li>
                    </ol>
                    </div>
                    <div id="tenC" class="col-sm"><img src="images/tenCommandments.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded" alt="large stones covered with vines with the 10 commandments on them"><!--Image by SHAWSHANK66 --></div>
                    </div>
                    God's word also says "whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all." <small>(James 2:10 NAS)</small> The apostle Paul plainly taught that "There is none righteous, not even one" <small>(Romans 3:10 NAS)</small>. If God were to judge you by your works according to the 10 commandments, would you be found as a liar? A thief? A blasphemer? Idolater? Jesus taught that all liars will have their part in the lake that burns with fire. <small>(Revelation 21:8)</small>
                    
                    <br><br>Why is this section called good news? The Good News (gospel) of the Christian faith is that Jesus met the demands of justice with His death on the cross, was buried, and rose again on the third day defeating death. <small>(1 Corinthians 15:1-4)</small>     
                    "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." <small>(Romans 6:23 NAS)</small> Although you are guilty before God, you can walk because Jesus paid the fine. Salvation is obtained by grace alone, through faith alone, in the work of Christ alone <small>(John 3:16)</small> and not by our good works <small>(Rom. 3:28; 4:1-5; 5:1; Eph. 2:8-9; Gal. 3:1-4; Matt. 7:22-23)</small>. All who, cry out to God like the tax collector who beat his chest and said "God be merciful to me the sinner" will be justified before God. <small>(Luke 18)</small> Jesus came not to call those who think they are righteous, but those who know they are sinners. <small>(Matthew 9:13)</small> If you have trusted in Christ and repented of your sins, start reading your Bible daily, just like you eat and drink. Find a bible teaching church, get connected with them, and pursue baptism. Live for the glory of Christ.

                Funny you should ask, λόγος (log'-os) is Koine Greek for "word".
                It's famous for being a title of Jesus Christ used in John 1.
                "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God and
                the Word was God." (John 1:1 NASB 1995)
